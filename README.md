### Final Round
- **Date:** Feb 25, 2024
- **Location:** Tark Technologies (Rajkot)
- This round will be conducted at Tark Technologies (Rajkot) and divided in two parts. During the first half, we will explain the problem statement and will also explain you the high level and design and solution of the problem statement, so that you become familiar with not just the problem but an approach to solve it. In the second half, you will have to code the solution using one of these programming languages: C++, Java, Python, C#. This will be a purely command line application and so you won't have to build any UI or integrate with any database.
